**Consolidate the duplicate asset error annotation.**

Lines 316-317 split the error annotation across two `printf` commands, producing a malformed GitHub Actions error annotation.



Apply this diff to consolidate the message:

```diff
-              printf '%s' '::error title=Duplicate release asset::Asset name '
-              printf '%s\n' "'${asset_name}' would be uploaded more than once"
+              printf '::error title=Duplicate release asset::Asset name '\''%s'\'' would be uploaded more than once\n' "${asset_name}"
```

.github/workflows/release.yml around lines 316 to 317: the GitHub Actions error
annotation is split across two printf calls which produces a malformed
annotation; replace the two separate printf commands with a single printf that
constructs the full '::error title=Duplicate release asset::Asset name
'<asset_name>' would be uploaded more than once' message (including the trailing
newline) so the annotation is emitted as one valid line.
