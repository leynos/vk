Consolidate the duplicate asset error annotation.

Lines 316-317 split the error annotation across two printf commands, producing a malformed GitHub Actions error annotation.

Apply this diff to consolidate the message:

-              printf '%s' '::error title=Duplicate release asset::Asset name '                                                        
-              printf '%s\n' "'${asset_name}' would be uploaded more than once"                                                        
+              printf '::error title=Duplicate release asset::Asset name '\''%s'\'' would be uploaded more than once\n' "${asset_name}"
